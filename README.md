# TCryptor
An encryptor and decryptor for the Terraria PLR files. Modify PLR files with a hex editor at your leisure and then encrypt them again.

## Why?
I Wanted to start a Terraria 1HP world, but to do that I needed an inventory editor. So I decided to write my own inventory editor, and I ended up with this.

# Installation
To install simply download the latest release of TCryptor. Extract the folder wherever you want. Then run the `setup.exe` file. Go to your start menu and right there should be TCryptor in the menu.

# Usage
When you launch TCryptor you will be greeted with a small window with a couple of text boxes and buttons. On the input text box either type in the path of the file you want to encrypt/decrypt. Or you can click the button next to the text box. Then you type in the folder path for the output or click the button next to the other text box. Once you've done all that simply click on either the Decrypt or Encrypt button. And a new file shall be created
